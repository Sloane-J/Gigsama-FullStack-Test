AI Bible Quotation App Test
Overview
Build an AI Bible Quotation App that listens live during sermons and displays Bible quotations in real time. When the user taps a button, the app streams voice to a server. The server transcribes the audio using OpenAI Whisper (tiny model), streams the transcription to Google Gemini Flash (or an equivalent model) to extract a Bible quote address (if detected or implied), queries a Bible database for the full quotation, and returns it for display.

Requirements
Frontend:

A simple interface (web or app) with a button to start/stop live voice streaming.
Real-time display of the Bible quotation.
Backend:

Accept a continuous audio stream from the frontend.
Transcribe the audio in real time using OpenAI Whisper (tiny).
Process the transcription with Google Gemini Flash (or an alternative AI model) to extract a Bible quote address when one is detected.
Query your Bible quotations database to retrieve the full quotation.
Return the full Bible quotation for live display on the frontend.
Flexibility:

You may use alternative AI models, stacks, or additional enhancements as desired.
The detection should be robust ie. handle explicit mentions of scriptures, scripture finding/quoting, implicit mentions eg. "Next Verse", etc just as in a sermon.
Resources
Design Specification:
